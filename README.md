# Parking Lot

The project provides real time service for parking lot.
The app provides the client the ability to give an image of a vehicle licence plate path and get a decision whether the vehicle is approved to enter the parking lot according to preset logic. 
furthermore, it provides the ability to give a directory path that contains multiple images and get results for all images in directory.
Last function of the app gives the client info about all rejected vehicles from last week.
